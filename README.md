# dotfiles

My bash dotfiles. Feel free to use or comment on.

### Usage
Really this is meant for myself, but you are free to use it as well. Once you clone the repo into `~/dotfiles/`. Just run `makesymlinks.sh` to create symlinks into your home directory. It should be smart enough to back up your previous dot files into `~/dotfiles_old`.

Credit to: https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles, I mostly stole this idea for my own files.
